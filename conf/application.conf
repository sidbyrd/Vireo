# Limit advisor's affiliation

# Shibboleth) receive an attribute similar to eduPersonAffilation which
# describes how the person is affiliated with the institution. When this
# parameter is supplied then you can limit advisors to only those who have a 
# particular affiliation(s). Supply all the acceptable affiliations below

# affiliations will be allowed to act as an advisor in Vireo and approve 
# applications.

# Locking submission fields
#
# Determine what fields should be locked during the submission process. If the
# authentication method is able to provide information about a person and that
# grouping of information listed below as locked then the student will not be
# able to edit that information during submission. If the authentication
# mechanism is not able to provide the information, or it is invalid, then 
# the student will always be able to edit the field no matter what the lock
# setting says. Available groups:
#
# "personal": first, middle, and last names along with birth year.
# "affiliation": department, degree, major.
# "contact": permanent and current phone, address, and email.
